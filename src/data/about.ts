I am a Software Engineer at [Walmart Global Tech](https://www.walmartconnect.com/), working on the AdTech Measurement and Reporting Team at Walmart Connect Ad Center. I specialize in building high-performance data pipelines and backend systems that process massive amounts of advertising and analytics data.

Before Walmart, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), where I worked on Compliance Big Data Engineering, developing pipelines that detect exceptions in market trading data. I've also had the opportunity to work with amazing teams at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/), [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/), and [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/).

I'm passionate about distributed systems, big data processing, and building scalable backend infrastructure. When I'm not debugging production issues or optimizing queries, I enjoy exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about tech, collaborate on a project, or just connect!

# Career Journey

- Started my professional journey at [Guavus Network Systems](https://www.thalesgroup.com/) (now part of Thales), working on big data analytics for telecom operators
- Developed micro-applications analyzing LTE data to improve customer experience and detect network anomalies
- Built a real-time streaming service processing Kafka data with < 0.5s latency for IP and mobile number mappings
- Interned at [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/) working on their Offline Inference Framework, improving ingestion performance by 10%
- Contributed to the open-source [Ray project](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/22486), adding support for snappy compressed files
- Spent a summer at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) building Hargow - a fast CLI tool in Rust for executing complex workloads in production
- Researched at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) on polymer representations and property prediction tasks, improving accuracy by 5%
- Joined [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer, reduced trade submission times from 2 minutes to 10 seconds using distributed processing
- Now at [Walmart Global Tech](https://www.walmartconnect.com/), building the Path to Conversion Unified Report and developing GenAI solutions for measurement and reporting
